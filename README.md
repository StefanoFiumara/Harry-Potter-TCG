# ⚡ Harry Potter TCG ⚡

## Introduction
This game is a digital recreation of the old Harry Potter Trading Card Game developed (and sadly discontinued) by Wizards of the Coast.

Unlike more generic tabletop card game platforms, this one is geared towards the Harry Potter TCG and aims to facilitate the aspect of building decks and playing the game online through a client that automatically enforces all game rules.

If you'd like to learn more about how the code in this repo is structured, the core concepts of the game engine are inspired by theliquidfire's CCG project series, which can be found here: http://theliquidfire.com/category/projects/ccg/

This game client is dedicated to the HP TCG Revival community, check them out on Facebook and Discord:
